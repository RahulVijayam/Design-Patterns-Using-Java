#Real Time Scenario
Let us Imagine that you are constructing a house, To Every house, the basic things are roofs, windows, walls, and doors. If you want a big house that means you would like to construct a house with swimming pool, garden, fancy statues or garage then the simplest solution will be extending the base class and creating the subclasses in order to cover all the requirements or parameters, But it is not a good solution because no.of parameters increases gradually, It's not good right.

Another Approach is Passing the all possible parameters(swimmingpool,garage,...) to the base class which can solve the problem of creating subclasses.

#problem
But Again problem arises, Some parameters are not required all the time, for example, the need for a swimming pool differs from person to person, In this Constructor method it is not possible to send only required features, that to it looks ugly because of passing too many parameters.Builder Design Pattern will provide a perfect solution to tackle this problem.

#solution 
The solution can be obtained by creating a new class called housebuilder.java where the code present in this file will allow us to create houses with only required parameters. It's Seems interesting Right, Hey! Don't be Tense, I Know that It is difficult to understand until unless we enter into the programming part, You Just gothrough the code, analyze, run it in your preferred IDE.
